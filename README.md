# Evalon

Goals:

- Create a layer on top of cloudflare with 1:1 compatibility with wrangler-based cloudflare workers.
- Focus on easy migration and CI/CD through GitHub
- Create my own custom improvements on the Cloudflare stack so creating authed, monetised agent tools (via OpenAPI, MCP, etc) becomes easier.
- Allow third parties to build other "stack preferences" on top of our Enterprise API.
