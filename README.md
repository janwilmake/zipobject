Monetised and authenticated cloudflare worker (using sponsorflare) that proxies request with monetisation and ratelimit in between, looking at response content size and charges $0.20/GB.

This is a great example of a small worker that adds ip-ratelimit, authentication, and monetisation in just over 100 lines of code, charging based on the response size!
